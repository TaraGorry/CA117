Task:
Write a program called best_v1_022.py that takes a filename 
as a single command line argument.
The named file contains a list of student marks where each 
line consists of a mark followed be a student name.
The program should print out the name of the student who 
achieved the highest mark as well of the mark itself. Where 
there is a joint top mark the program should print the name 
associated with the first one encountered.

Example Input:
64 Mary Ryan
89 Michael Murphy
22 Neymar
78 Jenny Smith
57 Patrick James McMahon
89 John Kelly
74 John C. Reilly

Example Output:
Best student: Michael Murphy
Best mark: 89

- If the filename specified on the command line cannot be 
  opened the program must make appropriate use of exception handling to display an error message and exit gracefully.

Example:
python3 best_v1_022.py best_v1_input_00_022.txtt
The file best_v1_input_00_022.txtt could not be opened.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

highest = 0
i = 0
while i < len(lines):
  line = lines[i].strip().split()
  mark = int(line[0])
  if mark > highest:
    highest = mark
    name = " ".join(line[1:])
  i += 1

print(f"Best student: {name})
print(f"Best mark: {highest})
