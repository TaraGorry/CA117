Task:
Bert and Ernie are playing a gessing game. Bert things of a 
number between 1 and 20 inclusive and Ernie trys to guess the 
number.
For each guess by Ernir, Bert tells him whether he needs to 
guess "higher", "lower" or is "correct".
Ernie suspects Bert may be cheating by changing the number 
during the game.
Write a program called guess_022.py that reads game logs from 
stdin and outputs "Bert can be trusted" if the log is consistent 
and "Bert is not to be trusted" if the log indicates Bert has 
changed the number mid-game.
Each log ends with a "correct".

Example Input 1:
5
higher
10
higher
18
lower
15
correct

Example Output 1:
Bert can be trusted

Example Input 2:
10
higher
7
higher
16
lower
19
correct

Example Input 2:
Bert is not to be trusted


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

lines = sys.stdin.read()
lines = lines.strip().split("\n")

guesses = []
bertsAnswer = []

for line in lines:
  if line[:].isdigit():
    guesses.append(line[:])
  else:
    bertsAnswer.append(line[:])

correctAnswer = guesses[-1]

truthBert = True
i = 0
while i < len(guesses) - 1:
  num = guesses[i]
  answer = bertsAnswer[i]
  if (answer == "higher") and (int(num) > int(correctAnswer)):
    truthBert = False
  elif (answer == "lower") and (int(num) < int(correctAnswer)):
    truthBert = False
  i += 1

if truthBert:
  print("Bert can be trusted")
else:
  print("Bert is not to be trusted")
