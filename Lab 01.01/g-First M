Write a program called firstm_011.py that reads lines of 
text from stdin.
The prigram should print each line with the first word that 
begins with a lower case "m" now capitalized.

Mickey Mouse was a kind of mouse.
Mickey Mouse was a kind of mouse. A mouse with a sense of 
humour.

Example Outout:

Mickey Mouse was a kind of Mouse. A mouse with a sense of 
humour.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
  output = ""
  found = False
  i = 0
  word = line.split(" ")
  while i < len(word):
    if word[i][0:1] == "m" and found is False:
      word[i] = word[i].capitalize()
      found = True
    output += word[i] + " "
    i += 1
  print(output.strip())
