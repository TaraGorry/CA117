You have some water and some buckets to fill.

Write a program called water_011.py that reads two lines of text from stdin.

Line 1 contains a single integer, N, the number of litres of water available. N is in the range 0-1000.

Line 2 lists the capacity in litres of one or more buckets. The capacity of each bucket is specified by a positive integer.

Buckets must be filled in the order specified on line 2.

Your program should output the number of buckets that can be completely filled before you run out of water.

In this example we have 10 litres of water. We fill the first bucket (taking 6 litres), we fill the second bucket (taking another 2 litres) but we run out of water before we have completely filled the third bucket (it requires 5 litres). We output 2 (the number of buckets completely filled):

Example Input:
10
6 2 5 1 1

Example Output:
2



Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

input = sys.stdin.readlines()
water = int(input[0])
buckets = input[1].split(" ")

for i in range(0, len(buckets)):
  buckets[i] = int(buckets[i])

counter = 0
for bucket in buckets:
  if water >= bucket:
    water = water - bucket
    counter += 1
  else:
    break
print(counter)
