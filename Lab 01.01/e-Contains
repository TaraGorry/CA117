Write a program called contains_011.py that reads lines of 
text from stdin.
Each line consists of two strings.
The program should print True if each of the characters in 
the first string is also in the second string (and False 
otherwise).
Note that once a character has been matched in the second 
string it cannot be matched again.
Also note that differences in case can be ignored.

Example Input:
c cat
AC cat
act caT
actt cat

Example Output:
True
True
True
False


Solition (Using for loops and if statements):

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    list = line.casefold().split(" ")
    a = list[0].rstrip()
    for char in list[1]:
        a = a.replace(char, "", 1)
    if len(a) > 0:
        print(False)
    else:
        print(True)



Solution (Using functions):

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

def contains(left, right):
  for c in left:
    if c not in right:
      return False
    right = right.replace(c, "", 1)
  return True

for line in sys.stdin:
  left, right = line.strip().lower().split()
  print(contains(left, right))
