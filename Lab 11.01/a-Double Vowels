Task:
Write a program called doubles_111.py that reads a list of words from stdin (one word per line and all lower-case).

Your program should print the word that contains most double cowels (two successice instances of the same vowel constitute a double vowel).

Note that each vowel can be used only one in a double vowel i.e. the string eee contains a single double vowel.

You can assume there will always be a unique winner.

Example Input:
cat doubles_stdin_00_111.txt
artist
engineer
beekeeper
programmer

Example Output:
python3 doubles_111.py < doubles_stdin_00_111.txt
beekeeper


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

double = {}
vowels = ["aa", "ee", "ii", "oo", "uu"]

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip()

  for v in vowels:
    if v in line.lower():
      double[line] = line.count(v)

word = ""
max = 0

for k, v in double.items():
  if v > max:
    max = v
    word = k

print(k)
