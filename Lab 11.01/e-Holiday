Task:
Wendy has decided to go onn a well-deserved cycling holiday.

She will sysle to her destination on day K and cycle home on 
day K + 2.

Wendy is flexible in terms of departure date but she wants to
 minimise the maximum tempeture she will encounter on each of
  her cycling days.

Write a program called holiday_111.py that reads in a single 
line of N integers. The integers represent the tempeture 
forecast for the next N days.

Your program should output the best day for Wendy to depart 
along with the maximum tempeture Wendy will encounter while 
cycling. If there is more than one option output the soonest 
one.

Example Input 1:
cat holiday_stdin_00_111.txt
18 27 34 28 30

Example Output 1:
python3 holiday_111.py < holiday_stdin_00_111.txt
2 28

Example Input 2:
cat holiday_stdin_01_111.txt
12 13 20 20 11

Example Output 2:
python3 holiday_111.py < holiday_stdin_01_111.txt
1 20


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

temps = [int(n) for n in sys.stdin.read().split()]

pairs = [max(temps[i], temps[i + 2]) for i in range(len(temps) - 2)]

print(pairs.index(min(pairs)) + 1, min(pairs))
