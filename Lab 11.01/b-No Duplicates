Task:
Write a program called nodups_111.py that reads text from stdin.

Your program should output the same text with every subsequent occurrence of a word (after its first) replaced be a full-stop.

Ignore case when comparing words.

Example Input:
cat nodups_stdin_00_111.txt
Once upon a time there was a Wicked Witch.
In fact there were so many wicked witches
it was hard to tell which witch was which!
As a result, a walk through the dark forest
was, for Rapunzel and Snow White, fraught
with danger.

Example Output:
python3 nodups_111.py < nodups_stdin_00_111.txt
Once upon a time there was . Wicked Witch.
In fact . were so many . witches
it . hard to tell which . . .
As . result, . walk through the dark forest
. for Rapunzel and Snow White, fraught
with danger.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

def replace(line, seen):
  
  output = []

  for word in line.split():
    tmp = "".join(c for c in word.lower() if c.isalnum())

    if tmp not in seen:
      seen.append(tmp)
      output.append(word)

    else:
      seen.append(".")
      output.append(".")
    
  return " ".join(output), seen


def main():
  
  seen = []
  lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]

  for line in lines:
    print(replace(line, seen)[0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
