Task:
In gaa_091.py define a Score class to model a GAA score. A score consists of a number of goals and points.

When your class is correctly implemented, running the following program should produce the given output.

from gaa_091 import Score

def main():

    s1 = Score()
    print(s1)

    s2 = Score(3, 12)
    assert(s2.goals == 3)
    assert(s2.points == 12)
    print(s2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

0 goal(s) and 0 point(s)
3 goal(s) and 12 point(s)


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

class Score(object):
  
  def __init__(self, goals=0, points=0):
    self.goals = goals
    self.points = points

  def __str__(self):
    return "{} goal(s) and {} point(s)".format(self.goals, self.points)
