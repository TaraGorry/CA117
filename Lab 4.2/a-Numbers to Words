Task:
Write a python program called nums2words_v1_042.py that maps 
lines of numbers to corresponding lines of text. The lines of numbers are read from stdin. The number of lines is arbitrary.

You can assume that everything read from stdin is a number and that number is in the range [0-10].


Example Input:

cat nums2words_v1_stdin_00_042.txt
5 1 2 0 6 7 9 10 8 8 3 4
4 3 9 8 2 6 3 0  7 7 1 9

Example Output:

python3 nums2words_v1_042.py < nums2words_v1_stdin_00_042.txt
five one two zero six seven nine ten eight eight three four
four three nine eight two six three zero seven seven one nine


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

nums2word = {
    0:"zero",
    1:"one",
    2:"two",
    3:"three",
    4:"four",
    5:"five",
    6:"six",
    7:"seven",
    8:"eight",
    9:"nine",
    10:"ten"
}

for num in sys.stdin:
  tokens = num.strip().split()
  output = [num2word[int(n)] for n in tokens]
  print(" ".join(output))
