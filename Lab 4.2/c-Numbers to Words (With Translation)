Task:
Write a python program called nums2words_v3_042.py that maps 
lines of numbers to corresponding lines of text. The lines of numbers are read from stdin. The number of lines is arbitrary.

You can assume that everything read from stdin is a number and that number is in the range [0-10].

The program takes as an argument a file that contains a mapping from English words to their translation. Your program must make appropriate use of this mapping.


Example File:
cat nums2words_v3_input_00_042.txt
zero naid
one aon
two do
three tri
four ceathar
five cuig
six se
seven seacht
eight ocht
nine naoi
ten deich

Example Input:
cat nums2words_v3_stdin_00_042.txt
5 1 2 0 6 7 9 10 8 8 3 4
4 3 9 8 2 6 3 0  7 7 1 9

Example Output:
python3 nums2words_v3_042.py nums2words_v3_input_00_042.txt < nums2words_v3_stdin_00_042.txt
cuig aon do naid se seacht naoi deich ocht ocht tri ceathar
ceathar tri naoi ocht do se tri naid seacht seacht aon naoi


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

nums2word = {
    0:"zero",
    1:"one",
    2:"two",
    3:"three",
    4:"four",
    5:"five",
    6:"six",
    7:"seven",
    8:"eight",
    9:"nine",
    10:"ten"
}

translation = {}

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
  for line in f.readlines():
    tokens = line.strip().split()
    translation[tokens[0]] = tokens[1]

for num in sys.stdin:
  tokens = num.strip().split()
  english = [num2word[int(n)] for n in tokens]
  translates = [translation[n] for n in english]
  print(" ".join(translations))
