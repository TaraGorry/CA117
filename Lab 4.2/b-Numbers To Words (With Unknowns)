Task:
Write a Python program calles nums2words_v2_042.py that maps 
lines of numbers to corresponding lines of text. The lines of 
numbers are read from stdin. The number of lines is arbitrary.

This time the data read from stdin can include integers outside of the range [0-10]. Every number in the rangs [0-10] should be mapped to corresponding text. Everything else however should be mapped to "unknown".


Example Input:

cat nums2words_v2_stdin_00_042.txt
5 1 2 33 6 7 99 10 8 8 3 12
14 3 9 8 2 6 3 0 -1 7 1 9 11

Example Output:

python3 nums2words_v2_042.py < nums2words_v2_stdin_00_042.txt
five one two unknown six seven unknown ten eight eight three unknown
unknown three nine eight two six three zero unknown seven one nine unknown


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

nums2word = {
    0:"zero",
    1:"one",
    2:"two",
    3:"three",
    4:"four",
    5:"five",
    6:"six",
    7:"seven",
    8:"eight",
    9:"nine",
    10:"ten"
}

def maps(num):
  if num not in num2word:
    return "unknown"
  return num2word[num]

for num in sys.stdin:
  tokens = num.strip().split()
  output = [maps(int(n)) for n in tokens]
  print(" ".join(output))
