Task:
Write a program called qnou_031.py that reads words from stdin 
(one word per line) and stores them all in a list.
Making appropriate use of a list comprehension and ignoring 
differences in case, have the program print a list of all words 
in the list that contain a q that is not immediately followed 
by a u.

Example Input:
question
Colloq
IQ
Iraq
Iraqi
q
Qatar
QED
q's
seq
inquest

Example Output:
Words with q but no u: ['Colloq', 'IQ', 'Iraq', 'Iraqi', 
'q', 'Qatar', 'QED', "q's", 'seq']


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

words = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]

def qnou(words):
  w = words.lower()
  w = replace("qu", "--")
  return "q" in w

qnou = [w for w in words if qnou(w)]
print("Words with q but no u:", qnou)
