Task:
A pangram is a phrase that includes at least one occurrence of each of the 26 letters, a-z.

Write a program called pangram_052.py that reads lines of text from stdin.

For each line of text read the program should print pangram if that line is a pangram.

If a line of text is not a pangram the program should print which letters are missing (i.e. those required to make it a pangram). These should be printed in lowercase and in increasing alphabetical order.

A letter occurs in the line of text if it occurs in either upper or lower case.

You can assume each line contains 1-100 characters.


Example Input:
cat pangram_stdin_00_052.txt
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
ThE QUICK brown fox jumps oVer the lazy dog.

Example Output:
python3 pangram_052.py < pangram_stdin_00_052.txt
pangram
pangram
missing eq
missing klmnopqrstuvwxyz


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

pangram = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip().spliy()
  word = ""
  for lineWord in line:
    lineWord = lineWord.lower()
    word += lineWord
  
  missing = ""
  for letter in pangram:
    if letter not in word:
      missing += letter

  if missing == "":
    print("pangram")
  else:
    print("missing " + missing)
