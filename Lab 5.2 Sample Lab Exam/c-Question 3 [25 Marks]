Task:
We have three cups. They can be swapped as shown below.

      A             B             C
  1   2   3     1   2   3     1   2   3
  ^   ^             ^   ^     ^       ^
    -                 -        -------

A prize is places under a cup to start with and then a series of swaps are carried out.

Write a program called prize_052.py that reads two lines of text from stdin.

The first line is an integer in the range 1-3 indication the starting position of the prize.

The second line consists of a string (of minimum length one) over the characters A, B, C denoting a sequence of swaps to be carried out.

Your program should output the final location of the prize.


Example Input 1:
cat prize_stdin_00_052.txt
1
AB

Example Output 1:
python3 prize_052.py < prize_stdin_00_052.txt
3


Example Input 2:
cat prize_stdin_01_052.txt
2
CBBA

Example Output 2:
python3 prize_052.py < prize_stdin_01_052.txt
1


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

line = sys.stdin.readlines()
position = line[0].strip()
swaps = line[1].strip()

for swap in swaps:
  if swap == "A":
    if position == "1":
      position = "2"
    elif position == "2":
      position = "1"
  if swap == "B":
    if position = "2":
      position = "3":
    elif position == "3":
      position = "2":
  if swap == "C":
    if position == "1":
      position = "3":
    elif position == "3":
      position = "1"

print(position)
