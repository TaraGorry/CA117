Task:
A nightclub has a maximum capacity of N (meaning at most N 
people are allowed inside at any time). N is an integer in 
the range [0-1000] inclusive.

The nightclub is initially empty. Groups of people then 
successively enter and leave the nightclub.

If a group tries to enter the nightclub, but their entry would cause the nightclub capacity to be exceeded, that group is denied entry and they go elsewhere.

Write a program called nughtclub_051.py that reads the capacity of the nightclub from stdin.

The program then reads zero or more lines of text from stdin.

Each line indicated the size M of each successive group that 
either attempted to enter (enter M) or left (leave M) the 
nightclub. M is a positive integer.

The number of people who leave the nightclub will never exceed the number of people currently inside the nightclub.

Your program should output the total number of groups that were denied entry to the nightclub.


Example Input:
cat nightclub_stdin_00_051.txt
10
enter 6
enter 5
leave 3
enter 7
enter 2

Example Output:
python3 nightclub_051.py < nightclub_stdin_00_051.txt
2

Explanation of the above example:
  - The caoacity of the nightclub is 10 people,
  - a group of 6 enters, leaving room for 4,
  - next a group of 5 attempts to enter but is denied entry since admitting the group would cause the nightclub capacity to be exceeded,
  - next 3 people leave, leaving room for 7,
  - next, a group of 7 enters, leaving room for no more,
  - next, a group of 2 attempts to entr but is denied entry,
  - the total number of groups dinied entry is 2 so the program outputs 2.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

enter = "enter"
leave = "leave"
cap = 0
denied = 0

for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
  line = line.strip()
  people = int(line[-1])
  if line.startswith(enter):
    if people > cap:
      denied += 1
    else:
      cap -= people
  elif line startswith(leave):
    cap += people
  else:
    cap = int(line)

print(denied)
