Task:
A tourist has visited various countries over the years. Some countries they have visited more than once.

For any tourist we have a record of each country they have visited and the year in which they visited. These records are in random order.

Write a program called tourist_061.py that will output in which year a tourist visited country C for the Kth time.

Input is read from stdin.

The first line contains integer N, the number of records, where, N >= 1.

The folloing N lines each consist of an arbitrary country name (all country names consists of a single word) followed by an arbitrary four-digit year (indicating the tourist visited that country in that year).

The final line containc C and K. (You can assume the tourist visited country at least K times.)


Example Input 1:
cat tourist_stdin_00_061.txt
6
Germany 1982
Ireland 2016
Vietnam 1999
Ireland 1982
Ireland 1989
Germany 2015
Ireland 2

Example Output 1:
python3 tourist_061.py < tourist_stdin_00_061.txt
1989

The output above indicates this tourist visisted Ireland for the second time in 1989.


Example Input 2:
cat tourist_stdin_01_061.txt
5
Ireland 2000
France 1987
Italy 1990
France 1990
France 1985
Italy 1

Example Output 2:
python3 tourist_061.py < tourist_stdin_01_061.txt
1990

The output above indicates this tourist visited Italy for the first time in 1990.


Solution:

import sys

def find_visit_year(records, country, k):
  visit_years = []
  for record_country, year in records:
    if record_country == country:
      visit_years.append(year)
  visit_years.sort()
  return visit_years[k - 1]

N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
records = [sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()]
C, K = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
C = int(C)
K = int(K)

visit_year = find_visit_year(records, C, K)

print(visit_year)
