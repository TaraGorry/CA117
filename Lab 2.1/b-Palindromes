Task:
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of
characters which reads the same backwards as forwards.
Allowances are made for capital letters, punctuation and 
white space (word dividers).
Write a program called palindrome_021.py that reads lines 
of text from stdin and prints True if the line is a palindrome 
and False otherwise.

HINTS:
  - Convert the string to lowercase first. Use pydoc to check
    out the str class documentation. You need to find a method 
    that will do the conversion for you.
  - You need to retain only alphanumeric characters. Again use 
    pydoc to check out the str class documentation to find a 
    method that will help you.
  - Once you have the string in the above form (i.e. in 
    lowercase with all non-alphanumeric characters removed) 
    then check whether it is the same sequence backwards as 
    forwards.

Example Input:
Step on no pets.
Step on no cats.
Able was I ere I saw Elba.
Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
Bananas
Abel was I ere
A
Aa
ABa
123.
1221.
4444444.
This is not a palindrome.

Example Output:
True
False
True
True
False
False
True
True
True
False
True
True
False

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import re

lines = sys.stdin.readlines()

for line in lines:
  line = re.sub(r"\W+", "", line)
  ispal = line.lower().strip()
  notpal = ispal[::-1]
  if ispal == notpal:
    print(True)
  else:
    print(False)
