Task:
Write a program called birthday_021.py that reads lines of 
text from stdin where each line consists of a person's date 
of birth.
A date of birth is specified by three integers: a day, a month 
and a year.
The program should determine on which day of the week each 
person was born on and print the corresponding line from the 
poem:

Monday’s child is fair of face
Tuesday’s child is full of grace
Wednesday’s child is full of woe
Thursday’s child has far to go
Friday’s child is loving and giving
Saturday’s child works hard for a living
Sunday’s child is fair and wise and good in every way

Example Input:
1 3 2001
12 10 2004
9 5 1874

Example Output:
You were born on a Thursday and Thursday's child has far to go.
You were born on a Tuesday and Tuesday's child is full of grace.
You were born on a Saturday and Saturday's child works hard for a living.

HINT:
Import the calender module. Use pydoc to look up the calendar.weekday() function. It will do the hard work for you.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import calendar

dobs = sys.stdin.readlines()

for dob in dobs:
  dob = dob.split()
  day = int(dob[0])
  month = int(dob[2])
  dayInt = calendar.weekday(year, month, day)
  if dayInt == 0:
    dayStr = "Monday"
    poem = "Monday's child is fair of face"
  if dayInt == 1:
    dayStr = "Tuesday"
    porm = "Tuesday's child is full of grace"
  if dayInt == 2:
    dayStr = "Wednesday"
    porm = "Wednesday's child is full of woe"
  if dayInt == 3:
    dayStr = "Thursday"
    poem = "Thursday's child has far to go"
  if dayInt == 4:
    dayStr = "Friday"
    poem = "Friday's child is loving and giving"
  if dayInt == 5:
    dayStr = "Saturday"
    poem = "Saturday's child works hard for a living"
  if dayInt == 6:
    dayStr = "Sunday"
    poem = "Sunday's chile is fair and wise and good in every way"
  print(f"You were born on a {dayStr} and {poem}.")
