Task:
Write a program called contacts_041.py that takes the name of 
a file of contacts as a single command line argument. Each 
line of the contacts file consists of a name and phone number.

Your program must read each contact and store if in a dictionary.
The dictionary's keys are names and the dictionary's values are the corresponding phone numbers.

Once the dictionary has been constructed the program should read all lines from stdin. Each line consists of a single name.

For each name the program should retieve and print the corresponding phone number. If a name connot be mapped to a phone number the program should print "No such contact".

For example, after construction a dictionary from contacts_input_00_041.py your program should produce the output below when reading from contacts_stdin_00_041.txt:

cat contacts_input_00_041.txt
Sue 085-6442378
Jimmy 086-1223277
Maggie 087-8822001
Amy 087-3240516
Wendy 086-9112645

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
  contacts = f.read()
  contacts = contacts.split()

contact = {}

for i in range(0, len(contacts), 2):
  contact[contacts[i]] = contacts[i + 1]

for name in sys.stdin:
  name = name.strip()
  if name in contact:
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Phone: {contact[name]}")
  else:
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print("No such contact")
