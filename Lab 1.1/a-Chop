Write a Python program called chop_011.py that reads lines
text from stdin. Each line consists of a single string.
The program should print out the string minus its first and 
last characters.
If there is nothing left after removing the first and last 
characters the program should not print anything.

Example Input:
Sally
walked
to
and
fro
impatiently

Example Output:
all
alke
n
r
mpatientl


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip()
  chopped = line[1:len(line) - 1]
  if len(chopped) > 0:
    print(chopped)
