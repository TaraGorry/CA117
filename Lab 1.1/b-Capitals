Write a program called capitals_011.py that reads lines of 
text from stdin.
Each line consists od a single string.
The program should capitalise the first and last characters
of the string and print the result.
You can assume every string contains at least two letters.

Example Input:
All
that
glitters
is
not
gold

Example Output:
AlL
ThaT 
GlitterS 
IS
NoT
GolD


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip()
  line = line.capitalize()
  capitalised = line[len(line) - 1]
  capitalised = capitalised.capitalize()
  word = line[:len(line) - 1] + capitalised
  print(word)
