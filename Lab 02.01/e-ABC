Task:
Write a program called abc_021.py that reads two lines of 
text from stdin.
The first line consists of three numbers: A, B, C. The number 
can be in any order but we know that A < B < C.
The second line specifies the order that your program should output the numbers.

Example Input 1:
6 4 2
CAB

Example Output 1:
6 2 4

Example Input 2:
1 5 3
ABC

Example Output 2:
1 3 5


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
nums = lines[0].split()
order = lines[1]
nums.sort(key = int)

abc = []
for char in order:
  if char == "A":
    abc.append(num[0])
  elif char == "B":
    abc.append(num[1])
  elif char == "C":
    abc.append(num[2])

abc = " ".join(abc)

print(abc)
