Task:
In module circle_062.py, define a function that returns True if two circles overlap and False otherwise.

A circle is defined by its center's x and y coordinates and its radius.

Your overlap function should take six parameters in the following order: x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2 (you must use there parameter names and in the specified order when defining your fucntion).

By default, circles are centered at (0,0) and redii are 1.

HINT: A function that works out the distance between two points might prove handy.

For exmaple:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from circle_062 import overlap

def main():
    print(overlap())
    print(overlap(10))
    print(overlap(10,10))
    print(overlap(10,10,10))
    print(overlap(10,0,10))
    print(overlap(10,0,1,8,0,1))
    print(overlap(10,0,1,8,0,2))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

True
False
False
False
True
False
True


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import math

def overlap(x1=0, y1=0, r1=1, x2=0, y2=0, r2=1):
  distance = math.sqet((x2- x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)
  return distance < (r1 + r2)
