Task:
A common greeting among teenagers is a hey

A valid hey consists of a h followed by one or more e's
followed by a y.

The correct reply to hey is another hey with double the number of e's.

For example:
  - to reply to hey you say heey.
  - to reply to heey you say heeeey.
  - to reply to heey you say heeeeeey.
  - etc.

Write a program called hey_051.py that reads one or more lines of text from stdin.

Each line consists of a valid hey.

For each hey read your program should output the correct reply.


Example Input:
cat hey_stdin_00_051.txt
hey
heey
heeey

Example Output:
python3 hey_051.py < hey_stdin_00_051.txt
heey
heeeey
heeeeeey


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
  hey = line.strip()
  heyCount = len(hey[1:-1])
  heyDouble = heyCount * 2
  heyReply = heyDouble * "e"
  heyOutput = hey[0] + heyReply + hey[-1]
  print(heyOutput)
