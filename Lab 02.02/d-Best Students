Task:
The previous programs print out a single name even when multiple 
students share the highest mark.
Write a program called bests_022.py that prints out the names 
of all students who achieved the highest mark.
Student names should be comma-separated and must be printed in 
order in which they occur in the input file.

Example Input:
64 Mary Ryan
89 Michael Murphy
22 Neymar
78 Jenny Smith
57 Patrick James McMahon
89 John Kelly
74 John C. Reilly

Example Output:
Best student(s): Michael Murphy, John Kelly
Best mark: 89


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()
  name = []

highest = 0
i = 0
while i < len(lines):
  line = lines[i].strip().split()
  mark = int(line[0])
  if mark > highest:
    highest = mark
  i += 1

j = 0
while j < len(lines):
  line = lines[j].strip().split()
  if int(line[0]) == highest:
    name = " ".join(line[1])
    names.append(name)
  j += 1

best = ", ".join(names)
print(f"Best student(s): {best}")
print(f"Best mark: {highest}")
