Task:
Write a program called primecomps_031.py that uses a for loop 
and the range() function to generate a list containing the 
numbers 2, 3, 4, ... , N (Where N is an integer supplied from 
stdin).
A prime number is one that is divisible only by itsself and one.
Use a list conprehension to have you program extract all prime 
numbers from the above list.

HINT:
Try to be efficient when looking for factors.

Example Input:
8
12

Example Output:
Primes: [2, 3, 5, 7]
Primes: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

numbers = sys.stdin.readlines()

def primes(number):
  return [n for n in range(2, number + 1) if isPrime(n)]

def isPrime(num):
  for i in range(2, num):
    if num % i == 0:
      return False
  return True 

for number in numbers:
  print("Primes:", primes(int(number)))
