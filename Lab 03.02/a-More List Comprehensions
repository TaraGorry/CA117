Task:
Write a program called wordcomps_032.py that reads words from 
stdin (one word per line) and stores them all in a list.

Using list comprehension and ignoring differences in case, 
have your program print the following:

  - The shortest word that contains all vowels ("aeiou").
  - A count of all the words that end in "iary".
  - A list of the words that contain the most e's.

Your program should produce the following output:

Shortest word containing all vowels: Sequoia
Words ending in iary: 14
Words with most e's: ['dereference', 'teleconference']


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

words = [w.strip() for w in sys.stdin.readlines()]

def allVowels(w):
  return "a" in w and "e" in w and "i" in w and "o" in w and "u" in w

allVowelsShortest = [w for w in words if allVowels(w.lower())]
print(f"Shortest word containing all vowels: {min(allVowelsShortest, key = len)}")

iaryWords = [w for w in words if w.endswith("iary")]
print(f"Words ending in iary: {len(iaryWords)}")

def mostEs(lines):
  mostEs = 0
  words = []
  for item in lines:
    eCount = [c for c in item if c == "e"]
    eNum = len(eCount)
    if eNum > mostEs:
      words = words[:0]
      words.append(item)
      mostEs = eNum
    if eNum == mostEs and item not in words:
      words.append(item)
  return words
print(f"Words with most e's: {mostEs(words)}")
