Task:
Write a program called censor_032.py that reads a list of censored 
strings from a file supplied on the command line.

The program should then read the text supplied on stdin and output the same but with each censored string replaced by a string of ampersands of the same length.

Example:

cat censor_input_00_032.txt
low
rose
smell
he


cat censor_stdin_00_032.txt
Sonnet 98
by William Shakespeare

From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April dress’d in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
That heavy Saturn laugh’d and leap’d with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summer’s story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
Yet seem’d it winter still, and, you away,
As with your shadow I with these did play.

Case should be ignored when looking for censored strings. Original case should be retained in the output.

Replace censored strings in the order they are listed. i.e. in the example above all instances of rose should be replaced before all instances of smell.


Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

text = sys.stdin.readlines()
censorWords = []

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
  string = f.readlines()
  for s in string:
    censorWords.append(s.strip())

for line in text:
  line = line.strip()
  for censor in sensorWords:
    if censor in line:
      line = line.replace(censor, "@" * len(censor))
  print("".join(line))
